# survey-form

# VERY IMPORTANT
Remember Docker? Docker holds containers and container can be seen as a computer inside your computer. The cool thing about this virtual computer is that you can send it to your friends. And when they start this computer and run your code, they will get exactly the same results as you did without worrying of any software and hardware requirements!

This time, we will make the Github Actions use Docker environment (instead of the default environment that Github Actions uses) to build and run our test cases. 

All you need to do is clone this repository "survey-form" and try to figure out whatâ€™s wrong in .github/workflows/action.yml. Focus on this file only when you're debugging. 

Good luck and have fun!
